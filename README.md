# FAQ Accordion
👉🏼 This is a simple FAQ Accordion built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. 
👉🏼 It features interactive FAQ items where answers can be toggled by clicking "+" icons. 
👉🏼 The project is responsive and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I learned

- CSS layout using "flexbox"
- Writing **responsive css** using `max-width`, `margin:auto`.
- Font styling using **Google Fonts**.
- JavaScript **DOM manipulation** and event handling.
- Simple animations using `transition`, `max-height`, and `opacity`.
- How to **test responsiveness** using browser DevTools.
- Local development using `live-server` and sharing with mobile devices via `0.0.0.0`.
